Turn this sveltekit app into a "linktree"-like lightweight one-page personal landing page / digital business card.

* if applicable, install the latest version of existing dependencies
* remove any unnecessary dependencies
* install and use tailwind
* the page should include:
  * my headshot image (located currently in static/)
  * my name ("Aaron Mamparo")
  * links to my socials (linkedin, github, bluesky, instagram, last.fm, email)
    * I'd like it to be easy to manage (add/remove/change) these links in one place
    * please utilize the sites' logos/icons. if you can do so with built-in tailwind things, great. otherwise, you may install whatever font/icon packages are ncessary.
* the site's look and feel should be minimalistic and modern, and should be mobile friendly
* the site should respect the user's system color scheme (light/dark mode), defaulting to dark mode if no preference is detected
  * in dark mode, use the headshot "headshot_dark.jpg" in static
  * in light mode, use "headshot_light.jpg"
